New Site
================

I'm on my holidays and I thought I'd pick up the old site again. This time I've gone for a pretty Oh-My-God-I-Love-Github approach.

What's it all about?
----------------

I spend quite a substantial chunk of my free time working on various side projects. Lots of these never reach a stage where they're viewable to the general internets.

Sometimes this is because they're heavily server side - I find writing C# without Visual Studio and [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) surprisingly frustrating and I don't have these tools at home. Sometimes it's beacuse they're pretty Acturis (the company I work for) specific and I don't feel like I can put my work in the public domain. Usually it's because I get the thing to proof of concept stage and then get bored with it. Part of the joy of side projects is being able to abandon them when they're not interesting anymore!

Anyway, this site aims to showcase a few of these as and when they appear. I'm also planning on writing a few blog posts about things that I find interesting. At the moment I'm particularly interested in the [T4 templating engine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx) and the [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) language, both from the (recently increasingly) impressive folks at Microsoft.

How does it work?
----------------

I'm using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate these pages and [github](https://github.com/) to host them. If you want to have a look at the raw source, it's available [here](https://github.com/richardTowers/richardtowers.github.com).

There are may advantages to using a tool like jekyll. The one's I'm enjoying most are not having to mess with a database, and being able to write all my content in the wonderful [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
