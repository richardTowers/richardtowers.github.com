Software, magic, and diversity
==============================

Long before people dreamed of computers, they dreamed of magic. Of names, of
power, of mastery over their world.

Stories tell of men of power. Of white wizards with flowing beards, casting
mighty spells and potent enchantments. With their power they influence
the course of their history and the very nature of their world.

They sometimes do great good, and sometimes great harm.

Although the magic of fiction doesn't appear in our world, there are
interesting parallels in the art-magic of software engineering.

In particular, many magical fictions seem to have disturbingly similar
levels of diversity to the software industry.

Where there are parallels, there are lessons. What can software engineers
learn from their fictional, wizarding cousins?

The magic of naming
-------------------

> But Taborlin knew the name of all things, and so all things were his to
  command. He said to the stone *'Break!'* and the stone broke. The wall tore
  like a piece of paper, and through that hole Taborlin could see the sky and
  breathe the sweet spring air. He stepped to the edge, looked down, and without
  a second thought he stepped out into the open air....

> So Taborlin fell, but he did not despair. For he knew the name of the wind,
  and so the wind obeyed him. He spoke to the wind and it cradled and caressed him.
  It bore him to the ground as gentle as a puff of thistledown and set him on his feet as softly as a mother's kiss.

Dystopia in magical fiction
---------------------------

Fiction warns us of the danger of concentrating power in uniform
groups - even benevolent wizards can do great harm through ignorance of
their world. Where magic is a purely masculine persuit, we see it twisted
to ends of aggression and domination.
