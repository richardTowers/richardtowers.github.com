On software, magic, and diversity
=================================

Long before the invention of computers, people dreamed of magic. Of names, of
power, of mastery over their world.

Stories tell of men of power. Of white wizards with flowing beards, casting
mighty spells and potent enchantments. With their power they influence
the course of their history and the very nature of their world.

They sometimes do great good, and sometimes great harm.

Although the magic of fiction doesn't appear in our world, there are
interesting parallels in the art-magic of software engineering.

In particular, many magical fictions seem to have disturbingly similar
levels of diversity to the software industry.

Where there are parallels, there are lessons. What can software engineers
learn from their fictional, wizarding cousins?

The magic of true names
-----------------------

> But Taborlin knew the name of all things, and so all things were his to
  command. He said to the stone *'Break!'* and the stone broke...

> *(The Name of the Wind, Patrick Rothfuss)*

In many works of fantasy, there's an idea that knowledge of something's True
Name gives one power over it.

Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicles uses this idea as the basis for "true
magic". Calling The Name of the Wind allows one to command it to be still, or
to blow. By calling The Name of Stone, stone can be broken or sculpted into
shapes.

A thing's True Name is intrinsically related its true nature. By
understanding a thing's nature, you can learn its True Name.

Character's in Rothfuss' stories go to great lengths to learn True Names -
standing naked in a storm to understand the true nature of wind, or walking
around a quarry with wet clay in their shoes to understand the true nature of
stone.

In some sense, writing code is like Naming: systems in the real world
have a true nature, and to write the code to model a system you need to
understand its nature. Ultimately, your code forms a program, which is
something very similar to a Name.

A program is not the same as the system it represents, yet its use has power.

A Name is not the same as the thing it belongs to, yet its use has power.

Anyone who's had to work with a legacy codebase or had to model a complex
business process should be easily be able to relate to the feeling of wandering
around a quarry with boots full of clay. Sometimes it can feel more like being
caught naked in a storm.

Spells and shells
-----------------

Simply using a computer can sometimes feel like magic. Using the command line
is much like casting spells - you say what you want to happen (using a
special language), and, as if by magic, it does happen.

Novice wizards can sometimes mess up their incantations, causing their spells
to have disastrous consequences (leaving them vomiting slugs). Novice
programmers can mess up their incantations too, causing their shells to do
things they didn't intend. Who hasn't accidentally deleted the wrong files by
not realising that `$DIRECTORY` contains spaces when running `rm -r
$DIRECTORY`?

As wizards and programmers become more experienced, they can achieve more and
more with these spells (and shells). This great power can enable them to do
some things in seconds that would take non-magical / non-technical folk
months.

Enchantments and scripts
------------------------

Having to be physically present every time you need to cast a spell would be
a problem, even for a powerful wizard. This is why enchantments are important -
by binding spells to an object, enchanters can reuse those spells without
having to recast them. Other people (even non-magical ones) can use
enchantments, even if they don't know or understand the original spells.

The analogy between enchantments and scripts is obvious. Using scripts,
programmers can string together shell commands save them in a file. Scripts
can be re-run without being typed in each time. Other people (even
non-technical ones) can use scripts, even if they don't know or understand
the original commands.

Diversity and inclusion in magic
--------------------------------

Different stories explore different ways magical power might be distributed
in a society.

### Harry Potter

J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" has perhaps the most diverse view of the magical
world. Magical power is inate in some children, and all of them are taught in
the same (free) school, regardless of gender, race or background.

There are fascist movements in this world that seek to discriminate and
exclude certain groups from magical knowledge. By monopolising magical power
these groups seek to dominate and rule.

Through organised, armed resistance, the fascist groups are defeated. Magical
education continues to be freely available for all people with magical
ability.

### The Kingkiller Chronicles

In the Kingkiller Chronicles' world (mentioned above), real magic is only
taught through The University - a fee paying school. This is generally
attended by the children of the rich. Men outnumber women ten to one.

The effects of this lack of diversity aren't explored in great depth in the
first two books, but it's clear that great power is wielded by a very small
number of arcanists.

In some situations magical power is used corruptly, but ordinary people do
not have the education to understand or challenge it.

### A Wizard of Earthsea

Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea has a clear divide between men's magic and
women's magic. Only men are taught magic formally, in the university on
Roke. Wizards are "men of power", while women's magic is used for "small"
things like midwifery, healing and animal husbandry.

This divide between men's magic and women's magic is so ingrained in the
minds of the characters that it can hardly be questioned.

> The Mages for Roke are men - their power is the power of men, their
knowledge is the knowledge of men. Both manhood and magery are built on
one rock: power belongs to men. If women had power, what would me be but
women who can't bear children? And what would women be but men who can?

In subtle ways men's monopoly on power consistently leads to trouble.

> "The men on Roke trust themselves and one another. Their power is pure,
nothing taints its purity, and so they take that purity for wisdom. They
cannot imagine doing wrong."

> "Maybe they need some women there to point that possibility out to them," she said, and he laughed.

Diversity and inclusion in technology
-------------------------------------


Dystopia in magical fiction
---------------------------

Fiction warns us of the danger of concentrating power in uniform groups -
even benevolent wizards can do great harm through ignorance of their world.
Where magic is a purely masculine pursuit, we see it twisted to ends of
aggression and domination.

In any case, it's a great thrill to live through a time where our fantastic
magical fictions are so close to being a reality for many of us.

In stories, magical power is not always used for good, and the same is true
of software. Even when magical power is intended for good, it doesn't always

Closing thoughts
----------------

Hopefully I've persuaded you that there's a strong similarity between magic
in fiction and modern technology, software in particular. This is perhaps
just an inversion of Arthur C. Clarke's famous third law:

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

"Magic will eventually be implemented by future technologists", perhaps.
