Hello Internets!
====================

I'm **Richard**, a web developer from York, England. I'm currently working for an insurance software house called Acturis, in The City of London.

I enjoy writing neat code. I mostly do this in C#, but I also have to dive into JavaScript from time to time. When I get a chance I like to
play with nicer client side languages like TypeScript and CoffeeScript.

This site will host a few of my side projects, and possibly a few blog posts if I ever get time! For more details, have a look at
[my first new blog post](/2012/12/16/new-site.html).
