<p>Hi! I'm Richard, a web developer from York in the UK. I'm currently working for an insurance software house, Acturis, in the City of London.</p>
<p>I enjoy writing neat code. I mostly do this in C#, but I also have to dive into JavaScript from time to time. When I get a chance I like to
play with nicer client side languages like TypeScript and CoffeeScript.</p>
<p>This site will host a few of my side projects, and possibly a few blog posts if I ever get time!</p>
